Hello. My name is Carlos Casas Conde, better known as ElChals. Although I donâ€™t have any background in anything related to cybersecurity, I really enjoy trying to solve good challenges related to hacking and participating in CTFs. I am specifically focused on the pwn category but open to learning about other fields in the near future.  
This blog will be my personal space to share my write-ups of some of the most interesting challenges I solve.
